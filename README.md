#Introduction

DentisCard is the project being developed by a group of students at department of Computer Science and Engineering at International Unviersity of Sarajevo.
The project is envisioned as a management system for dentists who have their own small to medium dentist clinic. 

#Roles
Dentist can CRUD patients, edit patient's medical history, edit his teett, set an appointment and accept or reject appointment that is requested by patient. Few clever things are done here, e.g. Dentist doesn't need to edit teeth, teeth are being edited from changes in medical history.

User is a role that is appointed to the patient that didn't choose a Dentist. User can see general udates about the system provided by Admin

Patient is a role that can request an appointment and get an e-mail upon appointment acceptance or rejection. Patient can change basic info about himself.
